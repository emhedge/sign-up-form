# sign-up-form
Created a sign-up form such as those shown to registering users on a new site.

Based on a project and template from The Odin Project, this project allowed me to put my CSS and HTML skills to use with form styling and validation. I applied flex, grid, pseudo-classes and -selectors, custom fonts, and custom properties.
